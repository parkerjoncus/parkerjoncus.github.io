            <h1 style="color:#999999">Stable Marriage Problem</h1><br>
            <p style="color:#999999">In one of my first classes at IIT, we were given the project of studying and implementing the stable marriage problem. This problem is a simple matching problem where you are trying to match men and women together based on their preferences such that the matchings are stable. The matchings are stable if there is no male and female such that they will both leave their current match for each other because they both prefer each other over their current match. The algorithm for this is to simply match each male with their first choice. If their first choice is already taken then you will then look at the females ordering and match her with who she prefers. For the male that was not selected, he will then be matched with his next prefered and so on until everyone is paired up. One of the weird outcomes of the algorithm is that whichever gender gets to choose will get their best possible match while the other gender will get their worst possible stable matching. This algorithm is still used in sorts today, mainly with medical students selecting the hospitals they want to intern or work at and hospitals choosing which students they want. The code for this project was creted in matlab but it was lost to my old computer being damaged by water.</p>
