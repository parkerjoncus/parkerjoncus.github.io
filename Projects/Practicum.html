            <p style="color:#999999">My senior year of college I teamed up with another student to work on a data science practicum project. We worked for a Chicago local company. The company asked if we could take their customer data and find why customers might no longer buy products from them. To answer their question we did a lot of explorartory analysis to determine which factors play into a customer leaving. We also created many different logistic regression models. These models statistically confirmed which factors played into losing a customers business. We were also able to give the company the logistic model so that they could determine the probabilty a customer may leave and idetentify high risk customers to market towards. The last thing we were able to do for the company, was to do some association analysis on the products the sell. They were hoping to see that some cross selling was happening. We found that little to no cross selling was occuring. This information was presented to the marketing department for them to investigate how they can improve cross selling. This project was coded in both R and Python. </p>
